# the superior wet market coin

To view samples (and try to steal my coinz): 
- [BlochainExplorer](http://159.223.96.145:8080/#/)
- [wallet](http://159.223.96.145:8081/#/)

to start a node you must have git installed as well as node (v16 works best)
```
#curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.2/install.sh | bash
#source ~/.bashrc
#nvm use 16
```

```
git clone https://github.com/hortinstein/mankocoin.git
```


[Development](https://lhartikk.github.io/) of manko coin was primarily done via: 

```grep -rli 'mankocoin' * | xargs -i@ sed -i 's/mankocoin/mankocoin/g' @```
